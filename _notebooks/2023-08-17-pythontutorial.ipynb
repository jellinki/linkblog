    "Python is a programming language that can be used to build websites, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. It has a simplistic appearance, which makes it easier to learn and understand; as such, many beginners start off with \"Python\" in order to learn the basics of code. Its variety of possible purposes also make it a versatile language in the coding world!  \n",

    "Okay, above, this is a short program that is a sort of guessing-game. The player can guess one of the computer's randomly generated numbers from 1 to 10. The program relies heavily on conditional statements such as \"if\", \"elif\", and \"else\". The \"if\" function poses a question to the computer to which it can reply with a response; these responses can be further developed through \"else\" (an outcome besides \"if\") \"elif\" (a secondary outcome besides else). In this particular program, if the player guesses a number that is too low, the \"if\" statement allows the computer to tell the player the guess is too low a value and prompts them to try again. The \"elif\" statement allows the computer to tell the player the guess is too high a value and prompts them to try again. Lastly, if the player guesses \"else\"--a number that is neither too low nor too high, in other words the perfect and correct number--the computer will tell the player that they are correct and commend them."
