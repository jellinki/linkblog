After I copied and pasted my code, ChatGPT told me that I had an error in my \"deleteInputLine\" function that needed to be corrected. It now allowed for the input element, label, and line break elements to be removed once the \"Delete\" button was hit, but now the Delete button would stay there even after the entry was deleted! To resolve this, I said: \"delete button works because it deletes the cell, but the delete button remains for cells that were already deleted\".  \n",
