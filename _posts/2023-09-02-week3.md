**Weekend (09.02.2023-09.04.2023)**  
Over the weekend, I tried to change the dot into an apple, but I ended up not committing these changes because they didn't work.

**Day 11 (09.05.2023)**  
Today, I was able to take a look at the goals I'm supposed to accomplish before our Pair Showcase this Friday. I tried to add the apple as a png, but it didn't work, so I tried an emoji instead. It still didn't work though, so there's obviously something I'm doing wrong. I'm going to try and amend this.  

Update: As soon as I got home and opened VSCode on my computer at home, the code worked! I don't know how it did--I didn't even make any changes. However, the apple emoji spawns with a few white colons to its left and right, so I need to get rid of them; also, when the snake touches the apple, it doesn't eat it. The apple stays there and the snake doesn't get any bigger. I'll find a way to fix this!  

**Day 12 (09.06.2023)**  
Today, I'm going to keep trying to add an apple so that the snake eats it. I also kind of want to add a few of my little Python games in there, but I don't really know how to make it show; will it have to be in a Python kernel inside an .ipynb file? I only know how to run them inside of a terminal, so I'll have to figure that out, too.  

Update: The code does work for the apple, but you have to hit the apple at a particular angle in order for the snake to eat it, which is pretty annoying. Maybe I can find a way to shrink the apple so that there's basically no way to *not* hit it? I don't know. I'll keep working at it, though.  

**Day 13 (09.07.2023)**  
Today, we're learning more about JavaScript and HTML. I also think I figured out how to remove the white colon things from the emoji! I'm going to commit these changes now.  

I'm also going to try and add a gif right now. Let's see if it works...
