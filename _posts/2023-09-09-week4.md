**Weekend (09.09.2023-09.10.2023)**  
Over the weekend, I had the ACT, so I wasn't able to code much.

**Day 15 (09.11.2023)**  
Today, I tried to start working on my calculator, but it wasn't really working so I didn't commit any changes. I'll keep trying to figure it out.  

**Day 16 (09.12.2023)**  
Today, I'm going to try adding my calculator again and changing the animations in the background. I also want to try editing the format of it so that the 4x4 will change to encompass the division key as well. I also need to change the gif for this page because I forgot to do it yesterday! I'll fix that as soon as I get home.  

Right now, I'm having a few problems with committing changes to my repository, so I'm trying to fix those right now. I tried to add a calculator page, but it wouldn't work and kept saying that it has changes from the future.  

**Day 17 (09.13.2023)**  
I tried to add the calculator, but I ended up having to remove its page because it was way too buggy. For some reason, when I modified it, it didn't give me any open cells to be able to type in values. When I tried to fix it, it just wouldn't work and it would show the "Calculator" page as my "Debugging with ChatGPT" page. I'm going to try again with a new notebook.  

**Day 18 (09.14.2023)**  
We started off today with a bit of lecture. Today, we were allowed to play around a little bit with JavaScript. 

**Day 19 (09.15.2023)**  
Happy birthday to both my aunt and my favorite cousin! I wonder if I can code a short birthday announcement. That would be pretty cool, right? I'm going to try that out.
