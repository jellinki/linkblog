**Weekend (09.09.2023-09.10.2023)**  
Over the weekend, I had the ACT, so I wasn't able to code much.

**Day 15 (09.11.2023)**  
Today, I tried to start working on my calculator, but it wasn't really working so I didn't commit any changes. I'll keep trying to figure it out.  

**Day 16 (09.12.2023)**  
Today, I'm going to try adding my calculator again and changing the animations in the background. I also want to try editing the format of it so that the 4x4 will change to encompass the division key as well. I also need to change the gif for this page because I forgot to do it yesterday! I'll fix that as soon as I get home.
