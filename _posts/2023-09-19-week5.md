**Weekend (09.16.2023-09.18.2023)**  
This weekend, I was able to successfully make changes to the grade calculator. I was able to create a "Delete" button that allowed you to remove entries that you no longer needed and a color factor that showed boxes in red if they were 60 or below, yellow for 61-80, and green for 81+ so that it showed how applicable the calculator was to the gradebook. I had a bug where the delete buttons wouldn't work after the colors were added, so I fixed this with ChatGPT.  

**Day 20 (09.19.2023)**  
Today, I'm trying to fix my JS Calculator. The buttons don't seem to be working; they keep showing as a column of random numbers. I don't know why this is. I'll keep trying to fix it.  

Update: I was able to correctly format the calculator! I also put cool pink outlines on it just to make it look nice.  

**Day 21 (09.20.2023)**  
Today, I did the Calculator Review with Daisy, Kaden, and Gabriel! We did pretty well, and I think we worked well as a time; Daisy helped me a lot with the calculator, and I helped her with the grade calculator. Our pairs kind of tag-teamed the assignment, and it worked out! Nice!  

**Day 22 (09.21.2023)**  
Today, I'm starting to get working on a sprite for our animation unit. You can take a wild guess at what I want my sprite to be.

Oh yeah. It's about to get funky.  

**Day 23 (09.22.2023)**  
Alright, so I'm starting to suspect that I am not supposed to be using a gif, since that's already animated, and use a bunch of pngs. I think I've found a good one on the internet; here it is below!

Isn't he so cute?! I think I'll use this one if I can.
