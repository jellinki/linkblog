**People**  
Collin Szeto: Class of 2021, Mech E at UCSD  
Tristan Copley: Works at LG currently, studies/studied(?) at Miramar College  
Mabel Szeto: Cognitive Science BS at UCSD, machine learning  
Anthony Vo: Computer Science BS at UCI, worked at Code Ninjas  

**Take-Aways**  
- just do a lot of applications  
- strong cognitive science programs at UCSD  
- CS is hard to switch into at UCSD because it is impacted and a lottery  
- you might want to look into more niche things like data science  
- ultimately, doesn't matter much where you go for undergrad  
- teachings positions of coding is helpful, ex: Code Ninjas  
- you can talk about your general impact that goes beyond a simple extracurricular  
- spend extra time making a project and building it!  
- experience will make you a lot better  
- having tangible evidence that you are capable helps employers to know that you are right for the job  
- UCSD does a lot of portfolios  
- find a website or company that you're interested in, so just make your own rendition of something that they already have  
- see if you can build something that you genuinely enjoy messing with; a hobby!  
- leetcode leetcode leetcode  
- but it's difficult :frown:  
- take a task and break it down if you're struggling  
- sveltekit

**Questions I'll Research on my Own**  
- is cognitive science a good major for pre-med?  
- what kind of projects can i code that would be suitable for my major?
