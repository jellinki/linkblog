**Weekend (09.23.2023-09.24.2023)**  
This weekend, I was trying to figure out some new ideas for sprites, but I decided to scrap them because I liked my originals more.  

**Day 24 (09.25.2023)**  
We started off with a Tech Talk. I'm supposed to incorporate some cool stuff into the test for more credit.  

**Day 25 (09.26.2023)**  
We started off with another Tech Talk. We have four weeks to create a little game that we'll be presenting on November 2nd for Night of the Museum. Right now, I'm trying to animate Link somehow.  

**Day 26 (09.27.2023)**  
Alright, so I tried to animate this image, but it isn't really working! I've put it on the page but it just...isn't working right. It's taking forever to run the kernel. I've decided to try optimizing my code for it by doing things like shrinking the image and reducing frame rate.  

Nice, it worked! Kind of! There aren't really animation-animations, but the image is definitely moving. It's a start.  

Okay, I've decided to try another attempt in a .js file below. Let's see if it works!
