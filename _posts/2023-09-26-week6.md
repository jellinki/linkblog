**Weekend (09.23.2023-09.24.2023)**  
This weekend, I was trying to figure out some new ideas for sprites, but I decided to scrap them because I liked my originals more.  

**Day 24 (09.25.2023)**  
We started off with a Tech Talk. I'm supposed to incorporate some cool stuff into the test for more credit.  

**Day 25 (09.26.2023)**  
We started off with another Tech Talk. We have four weeks to create a little game that we'll be presenting on November 2nd for Night of the Museum.
