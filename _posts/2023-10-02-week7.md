**Weekend (09.30.2023-10.01.2023)**  
This weekend, I touched up my code slightly but deleted it when I found out it was causing other parts of my code to malfunction.  

**Day 29 (10.02.2023)**  
Today, I finished up some of the hacks on the JS Errors because I realized that mine weren't working. When I walked into class, though, something weird happened; almost all of the Markdown code in the recent Web Development Jupyter Notebooks were no longer showing up in VSCode! They still showed up on my site, but this meant that I was now unable to change the frontmatter for these notebooks. I don't know what happened, and Mr. Mortensen said he'd never seen this happen before, so I'm really confused.  

**Day 30 (10.03.2023)**  
Today, we started drafting our game. We're going to do a jumping game sort of like Doodle Jump, but with a Link sprite.  

**Day 31 (10.04.2023)**  
Today, we got working on it to find a background. We're planning on doing a medieval sort of background to match the aesthetic.
