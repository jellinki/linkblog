**Weekend (10.07.2023-10.08.2023)**  
This weekend, I wasn't able to do much because of homecoming. I had fun there though!  

**Day 34 (10.09.2023)**  
Today, we made updates to the sprite code. We also began working on the background, and Gabriel's even drawing it himself! It looks great so far. Once he's done with that, I'll add code to randomly spawn in the platforms and trampolines.  

**Day 35 (10.10.2023)**  
Today, we're toying with an idea to add a few minigames to accompany our main game. The main idea is a rhythm-esque game called "Flip or Freeze!" where Link jumps on a trampoline. The screen will randomly prompt the player with a "Flip!" or a "Freeze!". If the player presses space for a "Flip!" command, Link will spin in the air. If the player presses space for a "Freeze!" command, Link will step off the trampoline and it will be game over. If Link does nothing for a "Freeze!" command, the game will proceed with Link jumping.  

**Day 36 (10.11.2023)**  
Today, I've decided to change a few things about the game. It won't really be a rhythm one, but a free-play one where the player can just use arrows to make Link perform actions like turning, jumping, and spinning. So far, Link is able to jump, but I want to make him walk!  

**Day 37 (10.12.2023)**  
Unfortunately, I have to leave early today to go to the dermatologist, so I'm not sure how much time I'll have to code. I'll try to be able to add right and left inputs, though.  

**Day 38 (10.13.2023)**  
Wow, it's Friday the 13th! We got evaluated today, and we did pretty good with an 1.85/2!  

Link now has left and right inputs using A and D thanks to Gabriel, so that's super cool. We also have a horizontal version of the game which is pretty fun to look at because it's so chaotic. We're now working on putting Link's new movement code into our main game!
