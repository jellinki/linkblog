**Weekend (10.07.2023-10.08.2023)**  
This weekend, I wasn't able to do much because of homecoming. I had fun there though!  

**Day 34 (10.09.2023)**  
Today, we made updates to the sprite code. We also began working on the background, and Gabriel's even drawing it himself! It looks great so far. Once he's done with that, I'll add code to randomly spawn in the platforms and trampolines.  

**Day 35 (10.10.2023)**  
Today, we're toying with an idea to add a few minigames to accompany our main game. The main idea is a rhythm-esque game called "Flip or Freeze!" where Link jumps on a trampoline. The screen will randomly prompt the player with a "Flip!" or a "Freeze!". If the player presses space for a "Flip!" command, Link will spin in the air. If the player presses space for a "Freeze!" command, Link will step off the trampoline and it will be game over. If Link does nothing for a "Freeze!" command, the game will proceed with Link jumping.
