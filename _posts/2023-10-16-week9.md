**Weekend (10.14.2023-10.15.2023)**  
This weekend, I wasn't able to do much because I was trying to recover from my condition. I have not fully recovered yet. Great!

**Day 39 (10.09.2023)**  
Today, we're learning about some new JavaScript terms. I have just learned that there is such a thing as a "Has-a" relationship; for example, a cat has a tail, has fur, and has the ability to make a sound. These are attributes; things that a cat has!  

Now, how would we store these in JavaScript? Well...

class Cat {
  constructor(furColor, weight, breed, sound) {
    // 'this' here is used to say that this attribute belongs to this class
    this.furColor = furColor;
    this.weight = weight;
    this.breed = breed;
    this.sound = sound;
  }
}


You would then need to define these variables with var. But, yeah, that's how it works!  

I also learned a new term called "polymorphic behavior"; the ability to treat many forms of an object as if they were the same.
