**Weekend (10.14.2023-10.15.2023)**  
This weekend, I wasn't able to do much because I was trying to recover from my condition. I have not fully recovered yet. Great!

**Day 39 (10.09.2023)**  
Today, we're learning about some new JavaScript terms. I have just learned that there is such a thing as a "Has-a" relationship; for example, a cat has a tail, has fur, and has the ability to make a sound. These are attributes; things that a cat has!  

Now, how would we store these in JavaScript? Well...

class Cat {
  constructor(furColor, weight, breed, sound) {
    // 'this' here is used to say that this attribute belongs to this class
    this.furColor = furColor;
    this.weight = weight;
    this.breed = breed;
    this.sound = sound;
  }
}


You would then need to define these variables with var. But, yeah, that's how it works!  

I also learned a new term called "polymorphic behavior"; the ability to treat many forms of an object as if they were the same.  

**Day 40 (10.18.2023)**  
I was absent today because I just found out I have a cool lifelong and incurable disease, so I didn't get to code.  

**Day 41 (10.19.2023)**  
Today, I'm going to try and fix some issues with the platforms in the game. Right now, they mostly spawn too far away from the player, so the player usually isn't able to jump and reach them.  

Update: Alright, honestly, it isn't exactly working for me. I'm thinking that I might just set a trampoline to spawn at the very start so that the player can definitely reach the nearest platform.
