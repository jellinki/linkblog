**Weekend (10.21.2023-10.22.2023)**  
Again, I wasn't able to do much because I was trying to recover from my condition. I have not fully recovered yet. Great!

**Day 43 (10.23.2023)**  
Today, I actually made a LOT of progress on our game! Link is now there with his movement and all. I'm working on making him die if he falls offscreen.  

**Day 44 (10.24.2023)**  
Today, I'm working on making the hitbox physics a little better so that the character doesn't randomly go on platforms.  

**Day 45 (10.25.2023)**  
Today, I worked on tweaking the scrolling speed and gravity.  

**Day 46 (10.26.2023)**  
Today, I'll try to keep working with the trampoline physics, but it's pretty weird. The sprite always disappears whenever I add them.
I also noticed that my updates for the past couple of weeks haven't been showing up because the csse.yml doesn't include weeks 8 and up, so I've just added them.  

**Day 47 (10.27.2023)**  
Today, we pretty much finalized(?) our game, and Link is able to jump around at a relatively fair speed. The hitboxes have been narrowed, so I think we're good to go.
