**Weekend (10.21.2023-10.22.2023)**  
Again, I wasn't able to do much because I was trying to recover from my condition. I have not fully recovered yet. Great!

**Day 43 (10.23.2023)**  
Today, I actually made a LOT of progress on our game! Link is now there with his movement and all. I'm working on making him die if he falls offscreen.  

**Day 44 (10.24.2023)**  
Today, I'm working on making the hitbox physics a little better so that the character doesn't randomly go on platforms.
