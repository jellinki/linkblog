**Weekend (10.28.2023-10.29.2023)**  
I wasn't able to do much this weekend because I kept having to leave the house.

**Day 48 (10.30.2023)**  
Today, I'm going to be working on my Individual Review that will be assessed in the upcoming days.  

**Day 49 (10.31.2023)**  
Happy Halloween! I worked on my review and uploaded some issues.  

**Break (11.01.2023)**  
Unfortunately, I didn't get much done because I was busy submitting all of my college apps.  

**Day 50 (11.02.2023)**  
Today was Night of the Museum! Our application attracted a lot of people and we got asked some good questions, so we gave them good answers. Also, my trampoline physics actually worked, which was surprising because I didn't think that they would. That was a once-in-a-lifetime thing, I guess.
