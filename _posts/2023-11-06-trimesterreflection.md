**Code Reflection**  

In Trimester 1 of CSSE, I learned how to fork repositories in order to obtain website templates. I then also learned to use Markdown files to create posts, as well as how to format and decorate these posts using frontmatter and HTML. I learned a lot of different commands as well, like "make" and "git pull" and "git commit", and to only commit after I've tested it out (I've definitely learned this the hard way! I've unfortunately gone through a lot of "git reverts" in my time). I also learned that you can honestly just put any image or gif you want in the "images" directory and use "image sources" to pull it whenever you want, which I think is really cool. I was also able to use Python to create minigames and Jupyter Notebooks to document everything I've learned as well. Additionally, I learned how to use JavaScript to animate sprites, animate backgrounds, create collisions, and more. There's so much that you can do with JavaScript that I think is really interesting, and I hope to learn more about it as we progress throughout the year.  

**Teamwork Reflection**  

CSSE has helped me grow into a person who was focused on my own individual ability to someone who worked with people as part of a team. In the beginning of CSSE, I wasn't a very good partner and I didn't help Daisy as much. However, as the year progressed, Daisy and I had more discussions with each other about our projects and helped each other proofread each other's code to make sure that it was up to standard, or even beyond the standard. We encouraged each other to put in a lot of effort so that we could truly develop as coders, and this motivation only grew when we consolidated our group with Gabriel's and Kaden's. Although we divided our roles, we made sure to update each other on what we were doing and how we did it so that we could all learn as a group. Overall, CSSE has taught me a lot about teamwork, so I'm really grateful to have had this experience.  

**Future Work**  

As the year progresses, I would like to learn more about JavaScript in the context of interactivity. I want to be able to make my blogposts more "fun" and apply things like buttons or color-changing functions to them. I would also like to learn a little more about app development, because I'm curious on how this works. I see that a lot of iOS apps are coded in C#, and I've heard a lot about it from my dad, so I would like to see how I could learn it.  

I could definitely still improve in terms of coding, because I know that I still have a long way to go. I sometimes feel like my projects are a little too simple, and I have a lot of ideas for what I want to do with them! I'm excited to learn more so that I can apply these big ideas. I want to do things like adding HP bars, enemy tracking movements, guaranteed platform physics, and more. With enough hard work and focus, I know that I will be able to learn how to do that.
