## Katelyn's Blog
Hello, welcome to my blog! My name is Katelyn Gelle. I am a senior at Del Norte High School. I am seventeen years old, and my favorite color is purple. Here are my classes this trimester:

<!--to make things appear on separate lines, add two spaces after each "line"-->
1st Period: Physics/Chemistry  
2nd Period: AP Statistics  
3rd Period: AP Literature & Composition  
4th Period: Computer Science  
5th Period: AP US Government & Politics  

Outside of school, I enjoy participating in Science Olympiad as both a coach and a competitor. I am a tutor in English and mathematics, and I love to both teach and play piano! Apart from these, I enjoy listening to K-Pop music, and will be going to ENHYPEN's concert in October :D
